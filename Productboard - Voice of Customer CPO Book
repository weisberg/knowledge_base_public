# A Product Leader's Guide to Building a Customer-Centric Product Organization



This guide provides a comprehensive framework for product leaders aiming to build and scale customer-centric practices within their organizations. It explores six essential pillars of customer-centric product leadership, from establishing foundational empathy to leveraging AI for scaled insights.



## The Customer-Centric Imperative



In today's rapidly evolving market, a deep understanding of customer needs is crucial for creating great products. While 85% of product professionals acknowledge that customer-centric companies excel by acting on feedback, only 34% report fully integrating user feedback into their development process. This gap presents both a challenge and an opportunity for product leaders. Building a truly customer-centric product organization requires a systematic approach that integrates customer insights into every aspect of product development, from strategic planning to daily decision-making. Product leaders must foster an environment where customer evidence drives innovation, feedback shapes roadmaps, and every team member instinctively considers customer benefit.



## At a glance...



The guide covers six key areas:

- **Building the right foundation for customer empathy**: This involves cultivating a common understanding across the organization through personas, segmentation, and more.
- **Setting your standard for customer engagement**: This focuses on defining expectations for Product Managers (PMs) regarding engaging with and listening to customers.
- **Making customer evidence a habit**: This explains how to integrate customer feedback into planning processes, from monthly reviews to annual planning, using a standard framework.
- **Amplifying the voice of your customer across the organization**: This details how to connect cross-functional stakeholders to customers by sharing insights and clarifying strategic decision-making.
- **Leading by example**: This highlights how product leaders can offer strategic guidance by dedicating time to their own customer insights analysis and large-scale strategic thinking.
- **Working from a single source of truth**: This covers operationalizing customer-centric practices at scale through tooling and AI-powered analysis.



## CHAPTER 1: Building the right foundation for customer empathy



Common definitions and language are essential for meaningful team discussions during product development. To create authentic customer empathy, a shared vocabulary must be built.

- **Tip 1: Define user personas according to jobs-to-be-done**.
  - Ensure well-defined user personas that are commonly understood by the entire product and design organization.
  - Go deeper than a user's role and needs by using the **jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework**.
  - The JTBD framework addresses both functional and emotional aspects of user needs, treating their need as a "job" your product can complete.
  - This shifts thinking from "what your product does for a user" to "**what you can help a user achieve**".
  - For example, for a remote work collaboration tool, a mid-level manager's JTBD might be: "Help me coordinate my distributed team efficiently while fostering a sense of belonging, so I can deliver projects on time without burning out my team members or myself".
  - Both personas and JTBD are important because different roles (e.g., product manager vs. UX researcher) may approach understanding the voice of the customer (VOC) differently, impacting product decisions.
  - Customer-aligned decision-making helps teams meet customer needs, increase satisfaction, and build a foundation for successful product bets that increase ROI.
- **Tip 2: Reminder: be precise about customer segmentation**.
  - A product's customer segmentation is typically more precise than a company's Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). Product leaders should guide PMs to think strategically about customer segmentation to avoid thinking too broadly.
  - For instance, a company might target various company sizes, but an advanced security offering might be aimed at larger enterprises.
  - Establishing the specific customer focus for different products or elements helps PMs gain a deeper understanding of the immediate user, leading to a better, more personalized user experience.
  - Product leaders should turn unspoken understandings into verbalized agreements.
  - Questions to ask your team include:
    - "How does our product-level segmentation differ from our company-level ICP, and why?"
    - "What unique characteristics or needs define the users of this particular product?"
    - "What are the distinct use cases for different customer segments?"
  - This is often defined in partnership with product marketing or other go-to-market teams, forming an important cross-functional foundation.
  - A clear view of target customers enables truly impactful conversations.



## CHAPTER 2: Setting your standard for customer engagement



Product managers should, at a minimum, meet with customers weekly, though this often doesn't happen, especially at larger companies. Actively listening to customers can become passive when other work takes priority. It's crucial to clarify expectations for the team, considering research types, depth of involvement, and needed behavior change.

- **Tip 3: Establish the type and frequency of your team's customer engagement activities**.
  - Customer engagement exists on a spectrum. Deciding the best practice, whether it's one hour of weekly customer interaction or two executive briefs per quarter, is important.
  - This may vary based on product lifecycle, uncertainty, and discovery needs.
  - Ask these questions to understand the current state and hypothesize improvements:
    - "How does the team currently spend time with customers?"
    - "What challenges are we currently facing related to our customers?"
    - "How can customer feedback help unblock or accelerate us at our current stage?"
    - "What methods would get us the level or quality of feedback we need?"
    - "How much time should be put into this on a monthly, weekly, or daily level?"
    - "What level of behavior change is needed from the team to carry this out?"
    - "What metrics or systems do we need to put in place to make this happen?"
  - Former VP of Product at Netflix, Gibson Biddle, describes their approach:
    - They used existing quantitative data to understand past and current behavior.
    - They conducted qualitative research (focus groups, one-on-ones, usability) to understand how people think and react.
    - They executed surveys to capture customer demographics, competitive product usage, and preferences.
    - They then A/B tested hypotheses formed from these inputs to see what worked.
  - While there's no substitute for speaking with customers, how it's implemented into team structure is flexible. Intentionality regarding the type of listening is important, relative to the product's lifecycle stage, team culture, and customer expectations.
  - Consistent listening activities will surface a wealth of customer knowledge that can be integrated into processes for planning and prioritization.



## CHAPTER 3: Making customer evidence a habit



Only 34% of product professionals report that user feedback is fully or highly integrated into their development process. Teams that fail to integrate user evidence risk misalignment with customers and creating the wrong products. To deliver excellent products, product leaders and teams must habitually place the voice of the customer at the center of their processes, starting with planning. As James Clear states, "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems". This comes down to communication during planning, the review rhythm, and the importance placed on feedback.

- **Tip 4: Make customer evidence non-negotiable**.
  - The voice of the customer should be the starting point for everything.
  - Ensure your team connects their proposals, actions, and explanations to specific customer feedback.
  - Ways to do this include:
    - Require customer evidence in all product review meetings.
    - Set the expectation that major decisions need supporting customer data.
    - Create templates that include dedicated sections for customer insights.
    - Coach product managers to lead with customer evidence in their proposals.
  - As the product leader, your actions of asking for customer feedback and demonstrating its influence on your decisions will be the most important accountability mechanism.
- **Tip 5: Set your regular checkpoints and don't deviate**.
  - Habits are solidified through routine. Product leaders should set clear expectations for their team's processes regarding incorporating the voice of the customer.
  - This could involve:
    - Monthly reviews that...
      - Review customer feedback trends across product lines.
      - Assess how recent releases align with customer expectations.
      - Track progress on customer-centric OKRs.
      - Evaluate the quality and quantity of customer interactions.
    - Quarterly planning that...
      - Analyzes aggregate customer feedback patterns.
      - Reviews customer success metrics and adoption data.
      - Validates roadmap priorities against customer evidence.
      - Assesses strategic initiatives through a customer impact lens.
    - Annual strategic planning where the team...
      - Presents year-over-year analysis of customer needs evolution.
      - Reviews major customer segments' changing requirements.
      - Evaluates portfolio decisions based on customer evidence.
      - Sets customer-centric goals for the coming year.
  - Consistent checkpoints at every stage are necessary to regularly facilitate engaging with customer feedback.
- **Tip 6: Clarify how your team should prioritize customer feedback**.
  - Product leaders must narrow the lens through which feedback is analyzed.
  - At the enterprise level, the breadth of feedback can create noise, distorting true customer pain points.
  - To make decisions that drive product forward and solve customer problems, your team needs to agree on how to prioritize feedback from different customers at a given time.
  - Christian Marek, VP of Product at Productboard, emphasizes that quotes and examples from strategic or important customers should be weighted higher due to their impact on decision-making, considering factors like revenue or retention impact.
  - Approaches to prioritizing customer feedback include:
    - Customer-Value Weighting
      - **Revenue impact**: Prioritizing feedback from high-value customers (e.g., enterprise clients over free-tier users).
      - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Assigning more weight to feedback from long-term or high-spending customers.
    - Engagement-Based Weighting
      - **Product Usage**: Giving more weight to feedback from frequent or power users.
      - **Feature Adoption**: Prioritizing feedback from users actively using a specific feature.
    - Volume-Based Weighting
      - **Frequency of Feedback or Number of Similar Reports**: Weighting recurring issues or feedback higher.
    - Sentiment-Based Weighting
      - **Emotion Analysis**: Using negative feedback to identify critical issues.
      - **Urgency of Feedback**: Using high-frustration comments to uncover immediate or urgent problems.
  - Your approach may change based on business goals or product development stage, and this difference should be clearly communicated to your team for accurate analysis and interpretation.
  - Working with the same information consistently and with clear expectations helps PMs build customer-centric habits, leading to products that maximize customer impact and ROI.



## CHAPTER 4: Amplifying the voice of the customer throughout the organization



A seamless path to customer centricity requires a cross-functional approach. Customer-centric product leaders and teams succeed when all teams (customer success, engineering, marketing, design, sales, etc.) are guided by the voice of the customer. The product organization has unique access to customer insights and a distinct opportunity to share this feedback with other teams. The product organization must act as a knowledge source, sharing insights and connecting them to business strategy.

- **Tip 7: Create channels to share customer insights with other departments**.
  - Product leaders should highlight the insights their organization gathers, regardless of whether there's a dedicated user research team or a small PM team.
  - Creating effective channels requires both structure and strategy.
  - Successful product leaders use approaches such as:
    - **Regular Customer Insight Newsletters**:
      - Create a bi-weekly or monthly newsletter highlighting key customer feedback themes, surprising discoveries, and success stories.
      - Keep it concise and actionable, focusing on insights useful for different departments.
      - Sales teams can learn about customer pain points and value propositions.
      - Marketing can gather authentic customer language and use cases.
      - Customer Success can anticipate common challenges and prepare solutions.
      - Engineering can better understand the impact of their work.
    - **Cross-Functional Customer Forums**:
      - Host monthly sessions where product teams share recent customer research findings and facilitate discussions about implications.
      - These forums should include representatives from all key departments.
      - Focus on specific themes or customer segments in each session.
      - Allow time for departments to share their own customer insights.
      - Result in clear action items for each team.
    - **Accessible Customer Insight Repository**:
      - Maintain a centralized location for all departments to access customer feedback, research findings, and insights.
      - This could be a dedicated section in your product management tool, a well-organized shared drive, a customer insight portal with searchable content, or regular summary reports of customer feedback themes.
    - **Customer Story Spotlights**:
      - Share detailed customer stories in company all-hands meetings or through internal channels.
      - These stories should highlight both successes and challenges.
      - Include specific quotes and examples.
      - Draw clear connections to company objectives.
      - Rotate through different customer segments.
  - Determine your product organization's approach to sharing customer stories and data based on your company's culture and communication style.
- **Tip 8: Create clear connections between customer insights and your business strategy**.
  - Product leaders are responsible for impacting wider business metrics (e.g., ARR, ROI), even if they don't fully own them.
  - It's important to connect product initiatives to both business metrics and the underlying customer evidence for those decisions.
  - This ensures product personnel understand the meaning of their work and clarifies the evidence fueling priorities for cross-functional stakeholders.
  - Pedro Amaral, Chief Product Officer at Reachdesk, states that alignment needs to come from the executive team. While some business objectives might be internal (e.g., reducing costs), the company's main strategy must resonate with the customer. It should be driven by a real customer problem and a significant market opportunity. He suggests framing it as: "We're going in this direction because customers face this challenge, and we believe solving it will create meaningful business impact, generating X amount in revenue".
  - Expand on high-level objectives with:
    - **Customer value impact**: Quantitative or qualitative improvements to a customer's life.
      - Example: "We are going to add AI to our product because it'll help our customers save 15 hours of work per week. Time savings of this significance will help CFOs validate the ROI of investing in our tool...."
    - **Customer evidence**: Stats, quotes, or research that reinforce your direction.
      - Example: "Our goal is to increase ARR by 15%. The top 10 accounts in our enterprise segment, which account for 25% of our business, see a critical need for this feature. If we ship it, our retention of these critical customers will improve and thus we will have a path to drive further expansion within these accounts, increasing our ARR."
  - This connection ensures business metrics remain grounded in customer value while providing clear context for cross-functional teams.



## CHAPTER 5: Leading by example



As a product leader, your value extends beyond supporting your team; it involves recognizing market trends and broader patterns to shape direction. While product managers focus on feature-level details, leaders need a high-level perspective to drive long-term strategy. Ibrahim Bashir, former VP of Product at Amplitude, states that product leadership's focus should be noticing market trends and judiciously shifting between problems based on market direction, forecasting market growth. The ambiguity increases significantly at the leadership level.

- **Tip 9: Let systems run on their own. Set aside time for big picture thinking**.
  - After integrating customer-centric best practices, a product leader's main challenge is avoiding the pull of tactical work.
  - Your team is responsible for customer evidence; you are responsible for forecasting evolving customer needs and subsequent market shifts.
  - To maintain strategic impact:
    - Block dedicated time weekly for high-level customer insight analysis.
    - Focus on patterns across product lines and market segments.
    - Look for emerging needs that could drive new product opportunities.
    - Identify strategic blind spots your organization may be missing.
  - Modern product leaders must anticipate where customer needs are heading:
    - Monitor changes in how customers adopt and use your technology.
    - Track emerging workflows and processes in your target industries.
    - Analyze how customer expectations are evolving based on broader technology trends.
    - Identify early signals of potential disruption in your market.
  - Ibrahim Bashir also emphasizes that while individual contributors gain direct feedback, executives are pulled away by operational rigor. Leaders must **carve out time to thoroughly examine their product and competitors' products**, talk to industry experts, and regularly meet with both happy and unhappy customers to form a market perspective.
  - Successful product-led organizations have rituals that organically expose people to customer feedback. Examples include Box's executive innovation center where customers frequently passed through, and Amazon's requirement for leaders to spend time in the customer service center. Companies that create ways for leaders to stay connected to the customer feedback loop tend to do well in the long run.



## CHAPTER 6: Working from a single source of truth



All recommended processes and frameworks aim to create a deep connection to your customer. Modern technology, including dedicated product management solutions and AI, enables product leaders to help their teams stay connected with customers more easily than ever by creating a single source of truth.

- **Tip 10: Consider software built for product management**.
  - A single source of truth for your product team ensures everyone is aligned on what's happening, when, and why.
  - Modern product management tools offer nuances that status quo tools (spreadsheets, slides), project management tools (Notion, Asana), and engineering workflow tools (Jira) lack.
  - **80% of Productboard customers report building products that better meet customer needs**.
  - Productboard enables teams to:
    - Collect feedback from disparate channels through API integrations and store it in one place for everyone to access.
    - Analyze customer feedback by revenue impact, company size, and feature/update requests to influence strategic planning.
    - Create an up-to-date, shareable roadmap with clear ties to customer feedback.
    - Make product operations more effective through visibility into every stage of the development cycle and where things are getting stuck.
    - Share a product portal that allows customers to vote or comment on features, updates, or new products they want to see.
  - Consider adopting a tool specifically for product management to embed the voice of the customer throughout all stages of your product development process.
- **Tip 11: Integrate AI into the flow of your work**.
  - Product teams make smart decisions based on qualitative and quantitative feedback. However, enterprise product teams receive vast amounts of feedback, making analysis a full-time job.
  - **AI-powered tools like Productboard Pulse can analyze thousands of qualitative customer inputs in minutes, immediately linking trends to features and generating shareable reports**.
  - Prioritize technologies that free up PMs' time while enabling faster, data-driven decisions.
  - Pedro Amaral, Chief Product Officer at Reachdesk, notes that beyond discovery calls, they co-create solutions with design partners, giving them a role in shaping the product. These partners get early access to validate functionality in real-world scenarios, providing feedback captured in Productboard for refinement before launch. They also use AI for feedback summarization, copywriting, and PRD (Product Requirements Document) creation, helping them move quickly while staying aligned with customer needs.
