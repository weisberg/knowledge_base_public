The future of AI is agentic.

Introduction

Generative AI agents mark a leap forward from traditional, standalone language models,

offering a dynamic approach to problem-solving and interaction. As defined in the original

Agents paper, an agent is an application engineered to achieve specific objectives by

perceiving its environment and strategically acting upon it using the tools at its disposal.

The fundamental principle of an agent lies in its synthesis of reasoning, logic, and access to

external information, enabling it to perform tasks and make decisions beyond the inherent

capabilities of the underlying model. These agents possess the capacity for autonomous

operation, independently pursuing their goals and proactively determining subsequent

actions, often without explicit instructions.

6

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025The architecture of an agent is composed of three essential elements that drive its behavior

and decision-making:

•  Model: Within the agent's framework, the term "model" pertains to the language

model (LM) that functions as the central decision-making unit, employing instruction-

based reasoning and logical frameworks. The model can vary from general-purpose to

multimodal or fine-tuned, depending on the agent's specific requirements.

•  Tools: Tools are critical for bridging the divide between the agent's internal capabilities

and the external world, facilitating interaction with external data and services. These

tools empower agents to access and process real-world information. Tools can include

extensions, functions, and data stores. Extensions bridge the gap between an API and

an agent, enabling agents to seamlessly execute APIs. Functions are self-contained

modules of code that accomplish specific tasks. Data stores provide access to dynamic

and up-to-date information, ensuring a model’s responses remain grounded in factuality

and relevance.

•  Orchestration layer: The orchestration layer is a cyclical process that dictates how the

agent assimilates information, engages in internal reasoning, and leverages that reasoning

to inform its subsequent action or decision. This layer is responsible for maintaining

memory, state, reasoning, and planning. It employs prompt engineering frameworks to

steer reasoning and planning, facilitating more effective interaction with the environment

and task completion. Reasoning techniques such as ReAct, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and

Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) can be applied within this layer.

Building on these foundational concepts, this companion paper is designed for developers

and serves as a "102" guide to more advanced topics. It offers in-depth explorations of agent

evaluation methodologies and practical applications of Google agent products for enhancing

agent capabilities in solving complex, real-world problems.

7

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025While exploring these theoretical concepts, we'll examine how they manifest in real-world

implementations, with a particular focus on automotive AI as a compelling case study. The

automotive domain exemplifies the challenges and opportunities of multi-agent architectures

in production environments. Modern vehicles demand conversational interfaces that function

with or without connectivity, balance between on-device and cloud processing for both

safety and user experience, and seamlessly coordinate specialized capabilities across

navigation, media control, messaging, and vehicle systems. Through this automotive lens,

we'll see how different coordination patterns -- hierarchical, collaborative, and peer-to-

peer -- come together to create robust, responsive user experiences in environments with

significant constraints. This case study illustrates the practical application of multi-agent

systems that businesses across industries can adapt to their specific domains.

Anyone who has built with gen AI quickly realizes it’s easy to get from an idea to a proof-of-

concept, but it can be quite difficult to ensure high quality results and get to production - gen

AI agents are no exception. Quality and Reliability are the most cited concerns for deploying

to production, and the “AgentOps” process is a solution to optimize agent building.

AgentOps

Over the past two years, the field of Generative AI (GenAI) has undergone significant

changes, with enterprise customers focusing on how to operationalize related solutions. This

has resulted in various terms describing the operationalization of GenAI, such as MLOps for

GenAI, LLMOps, FMOps, and GenAIOps.

Agent and Operations (AgentOps) is a subcategory of GenAIOps that focuses on the efficient

operationalization of Agents. Its main additional components include internal and external

tool management, agent brain prompt (goal, profile, instructions) and orchestration, memory,

and task decomposition.

8

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 1. Relationship between DevOps, MLOps, and AgentOps.13

Each of these “Ops” requires capabilities like version control, automated deployments

through CI/CD, testing, logging, security and (critically) metrics. Each system often

implements some form of optimization based on metrics – measuring what your system

is and isn’t doing, measuring the outcomes and business metrics, and automating the

processes for more holistic metrics, and incrementally improving step by step. This practice

might be called “A/B experimentation” or “ML Ops” or “Metrics Driven development",

but they derive from the same general approach and we will rely on those principles for

AgentOps as well.

Remember that new practices don't replace the old. DevOps and MLOps best practices

are still necessary for AgentOps, as they are dependencies. For example, Agent tool use,

where APIs are invoked based on agent orchestration, often uses the same APIs you would

9

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025invoke with non-agentic software. Authentication and secret management, security, privacy,

exception handling, throttling, quotas, and scalability are still critical and require careful API

design in addition to Agent design.

Let’s go ahead and define these “ops” terms to help distinguish between them:

•  Development and Operations (DevOps) is the practice of efficiently productionizing

deterministic software applications by integrating the elements of people, processes, and

technology. DevOps serves as the foundation for all the following terms.

•  Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) builds upon the capabilities of DevOps and

concentrates on the efficient productionization of ML models. The primary distinction is

that the output of an ML model is non-deterministic and relies on the input data (garbage

in, garbage out).

•  Foundation Model Operations (FMOps) expands upon the capabilities of MLOps

and focuses on the efficient productionization of pre-trained (trained from scratch) or

customized (fine-tuned) FMs.

•  Prompt and Operations (PromptOps) is a subcategory of GenAIOps that focuses

on operationalizing prompts effectively. Its main additional capabilities include prompt

storage, lineage, metadata management (including evaluation scores), a centralized

prompt template registry, and a prompt optimizer.

•  RAG and Operations (RAGOps) is a subcategory of GenAIOps that centers on efficiently

operationalizing RAG solutions. Its primary additional capabilities include the retrieval

process through offline data preparation (encompassing cleaning, chunking, vectorization,

similarity search, and re-ranking) and the generation process through prompt

augmentation and grounding.

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025•  Agent and Operations (AgentOps) is a subcategory of GenAIOps that focuses on the

efficient operationalization of Agents. Its main additional components include internal

and external tool management, agent brain prompt (goal, profile, instructions) and

orchestration, memory, and task decomposition.

Figure 2. Each of these “Ops” are about technology, processes, and people14

All of these “Ops” are, in essence, the harmonious blend of people, processes, and

technologies working together to efficiently deploy machine learning solutions into a

live production environment. It’s crucial to recognize that Ops extends beyond mere

technology; it’s not simply about constructing and delivering a ML pipeline. Successful Ops

implementations delve deeper, considering the customer’s operational model, their existing

business units, and their overall organizational structure. This holistic approach ensures that

the technology is tailored to their specific needs, seamlessly integrating into the business

and maximizing value.

11

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025The next section will cover Agent Evaluation in detail, which is a significant part of the story

for AgentOps and automation to capture useful metrics. Before we go there, let’s start with a

thought experiment; imagine setting up an A/B experiment in production for your new Agent.

The treatment arm gets your new agent and the control arm does not.  In that scenario, what

metrics are you measuring to determine if the treatment arm is doing better? What metrics

are you measuring to determine ROI for the project? Is it a goal being accomplished, or

sales totals, or a set of critical steps in a user journey? Those metrics must be understood,

instrumented and easily analyzed in addition to more detailed Agent Evaluation metrics.

Agent Success Metrics

Metrics are critical to building, monitoring, and comparing revisions of Agents. Business

metrics, like revenue or user engagement, are probably outside of the scope of the agent

itself but these should be the north star metric for your agents.

Most Agents are designed around accomplishing goals, so goal completion rate is a key

metric to track. Similarly, a goal might be broken down into a few critical tasks or critical

user interactions. Each of these critical tasks and interactions should be independently

instrumented and measured.

So before we get into the details of the Agent itself, we already have several metrics

identified which you should be able to easily track on a dashboard. Each business metric,

goal, or critical interaction, will be aggregated in a familiar fashion: attempts, successes,

rates, etc. Additionally, metrics you should be able to get from any application telemetry

system are very important to track for agents as well, metrics like latency, errors, etc.

12

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025None of these metrics are specific to Agents, you could track them for any software, but they

are even more important for Agent builders. Deterministic code does only what you tell it to

do, whereas an agent can do a lot more, relying on LLMs which are trained on huge amounts

of data. Instrumentation of these high level metrics is an important part of observability.

You can think of them as Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for the agent, and they allow for

observability in the aggregate, a higher level perspective of your agents.

Human feedback is one of the more critical metrics to track as well. A simple 👍👎 or user
feedback form, within the context of an agent or task can go a long way to understanding

where your agent does well and where it needs improvement. This feedback can come from

end users of a consumer system, but also employees, QA testers, and process or domain

experts reviewing the agent.

More detailed observability is also very important for agent building, being able to see and

understand what the agent is doing and why it’s doing that. An agent can be instrumented

with “trace” to log all of the inner workings of the agent, not only the critically important

tasks and user interactions. You could conceptually measure every internal step as metrics,

but that is rarely done. Instead these detailed traces are used to debug an agent when

metrics or manual testing show a problem, you can dig into details and see what went wrong.

13

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 3: An example of Cloud Observability showing traces for an agent with tools and LLM
OpenTelemetry spans.15

So far we’ve been talking about business metrics, goals, tasks, human feedback, and traces

– those are all ways of understanding the actions and impact of your agents, in production.

While developing an agent, in addition to manual testing, automated testing will be much

more efficient in the long run and provide greater insights into the behavior of agents.

Agent Evaluation

To bridge the gap between a proof-of-concept and a production-ready AI agent, a robust

and automated evaluation framework is essential. Unlike evaluating generative models, where

the focus is primarily on the final output, agent evaluation requires a deeper understanding of

the decision-making process. Agent evaluation can be broken down into three components

that we discuss in this chapter:

1.  Assessing Agent Capabilities: Evaluating an agent's core abilities, such as its capacity to

understand instructions and reason logically.

14

Agents CompanionFebruary 20252.  Evaluating Trajectory and Tool Use: Analyzing the steps an agent takes to reach a

solution, including its choice of tools, strategies, and the efficiency of its approach.

3.  Evaluating the Final Response: Assessing the quality, relevance, and correctness of the

agent's final output.

Assessing Agent Capabilities

Before evaluating your specific agentic use cases, publicly available benchmarks and

technical reports can provide insight into core capabilities and limitations to consider when

building out your agentic use cases. Public benchmarks exist for most fundamental agentic

capabilities like model performance, hallucinations, tool calling and planning. For example,

tool calling, the ability to select and use appropriate tools, is demonstrated by benchmarks

like the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)16 and τ-bench17 that also outlines

common mistakes. Another example, PlanBench18 aims to assess planning and reasoning,

across several domains and specific capabilities.

But tool calling and planning is not the only capability you should consider. Agents inherit

behaviors from their LLMs and each of their other components. Likewise, agent and user

interactions have a history in traditional conversational design systems and workflow

systems, and therefore can inherit the set of metrics and measurements that are used to

determine the efficacy of these systems.

15

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 4: A high level diagram of AgentBench.19

Holistic agent benchmarks like AgentBench19 try to capture end-to-end performance across

several scenarios. This is more realistic, when the scenario reflects your agent use case,

but not if it’s testing capabilities your agent doesn’t implement. It is difficult to simulate

the environment, tools, instructions, and use case requirements in ways that are both

specific and general at the same time. Companies and organizations are setting up public

benchmarks for specialized use cases, like Adyen’s Data Analyst leaderboard DBAStep20

which may give you a more targeted evaluation - if you understand both the evaluation

approach and the agents who are on the leaderboard.

Public benchmarks are a valuable starting point, to get a feeling for what is possible and

identify pitfalls to look out for. Most benchmark assessments include discussions of common

failure modes that can guide you in setting up your own, use-case specific evaluation

framework.

16

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Beyond public evaluations, you will want to evaluate the behavior of your agent across a

variety of scenarios to ensure it does what you want it to do. You are simulating interactions

with your agent and evaluating how it responds. This includes the evaluating final response

and also the set of steps it takes along the way (trajectory). Those are the 2 most common

and practical approaches we recommend you start with. There are many other evaluation

techniques you can use beyond these, either for finer details on sub-components or

broader approaches.

Software engineers will compare this to automated testing of code.  Investing in automated

tests saves you time and gives you confidence in the software you are building. With agents,

this automation pays off faster, in both time and confidence. Curating the evaluation data

set will be extremely important for accurately representing the use case your agent will

encounter, even more so than in software testing.

Evaluating Trajectory and Tool Use

An agent usually does several actions before it responds back to the user.  It might compare

the user input with session history to disambiguate a term, or lookup a policy document,

search a knowledge base or invoke an API to save a ticket. Each of those actions is a step on

a path, also called a “trajectory” of actions. Every time your agent does something, there’s a

trajectory of actions under the hood.

Comparing the trajectory that you expect the agent to take vs the trajectory that the agent

actually took, is particularly useful for developers who want to debug their application,

identifying errors or inefficiencies, and ultimately improving performance.

17

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 5: LangSmith diagram of final evaluation and trajectory.21

The following six ground-truth-based automated trajectory evaluations provide different

lenses to assess the performance of an agent:

1.  Exact match: Requires the AI agent to produce a sequence of actions (a "trajectory") that

perfectly mirrors the ideal solution. This is the most rigid metric, allowing no deviation from

the expected path.

2.  In-order match: This metric assesses an agent's ability to complete the expected

trajectory, while accommodating extra, unpenalized actions. Success is defined by

completing the core steps in order, with flexibility for additional actions.

3.  Any-order match: Compared to in-order match, this metric now disregards the order. It

asks if the agent included all necessary actions, but does not look into the order of actions

taken and also allows for extra steps.

18

Agents CompanionFebruary 20254.  Precision: How many of the tool calls in the predicted trajectory are actually relevant or

correct according to the reference trajectory?

5.  Recall: How many of the essential tool calls from the reference trajectory are actually

captured in the predicted trajectory?

6.  Single-tool use: Understand if a specific action is within the agent's trajectory. This

metric is useful to understand if the agent has learned to utilize a particular tool yet.

Figure 6: A radar chart plotting a single trajectory evaluation with a few metrics.24

19

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Consider these metrics as different lenses for analyzing and debugging your agent's

trajectory. Each metric offers a unique perspective, but not all will be relevant to every

situation. For instance, some use cases demand strict adherence to the ideal trajectory, while

others allow for more creative deviations. A clear limitation of this evaluation approach is that

you need to have a reference trajectory in place for this to work. While ground-truth-based

automated trajectory evaluations that are discussed here are prevalent in popular libraries.

Research is advancing the use of agent autoraters for more efficient evaluation, for example

Agent as a Judge, 202422.

Evaluating the Final Response

The final response evaluation boils down to a simple question: Does your agent achieve its

goals? You can define custom success criteria, tailored to your specific needs, to measure

this. For example, you could assess whether a retail chatbot accurately answers product

questions, or whether a research agent effectively summarizes findings with the appropriate

tone and style. To automate this process, you can use autorater. An autorater is an LLM

that acts as a judge. Given the input prompts and the generated response, it mirrors

human evaluation by assessing the response against a set of user-provided criteria. For

this evaluation to work, it is crucial to consider that given the absence of ground-truth, you

need to be very precise in defining your evaluation criteria, as this is the core of what your

evaluation is looking at. You find a number of predefined criteria in various libraries, treat

them as a starting point and tweak them to provide your definition of good.

20

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation

The fields of agent development and agent evaluation are rapidly evolving. Evaluating

AI agents presents significant challenges, including defining clear objectives, designing

realistic environments, managing stochastic behavior, and ensuring fairness and bias

mitigation, particularly in socially impactful applications. Therefore, it's crucial to incorporate

a human-in-the-loop approach alongside the automated evaluations discussed previously

(which involve predefined metrics and autoraters). Human-in-the-loop is valuable for tasks

requiring subjective judgment or creative problem-solving, it can also serve to calibrate and

double-check if your automated evaluation approaches actually work and align with your

preferences. Key benefits include:

•  Subjectivity: Humans can evaluate qualities that are difficult to quantify, such as

creativity, common sense, and nuance.

•  Contextual Understanding: Human evaluators can consider the broader context of the

agent's actions and their implications.

•

Iterative Improvement: Human feedback provides valuable insights for refining the

agent's behavior and learning process.

•  Evaluating the evaluator: Human feedback can provide a signal to calibrate and refine

your autoraters.

To implement human-in-the-loop evaluation, consider these methods:

•  Direct Assessment: Human experts directly rate or score the agent's performance on

specific tasks.

•  Comparative Evaluation: Experts compare the agent's performance to that of other

agents or your previous iterations.

21

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025•  User Studies: Participants interact with the agent and provide feedback on its behavior,

usability, and overall effectiveness.

More about Agent Evaluation

In this section we cover agent evaluation from the practical perspective. But this is just the tip

of the iceberg.  Agent evaluation presents many challenges. Evaluation data for your agents

may be difficult to find. While synthetic data or LLMs as judges can be used, evaluations

may still be incomplete. Also, LLM-as-a-Judge metrics, for example, may prioritize final

outcomes over the agent's reasoning and intermediate actions, potentially missing key

insights. Additionally, as evaluations for agent systems have a history in conversational and

workflow systems, there is so much to explore on how to inherit methods and metrics to

evaluate agent's capabilities, such as the ability to improve task performance over multiple

interactions. Evaluations for multi-modal generations pose additional complexities; images,

audio, and video evaluations require their own evaluation methods and metrics. Finally, real-

world environments pose further challenges, as they are dynamic and unpredictable, making

it difficult to evaluate agents in controlled settings.

Looking ahead, to solve these open challenges, the field of agent evaluation is evolving

rapidly. Key trends include a shift towards process-based evaluation, prioritizing the

understanding of agent reasoning; an increase in AI-assisted evaluation methods for

improved scalability; and a stronger focus on real-world application contexts. The

development of new standardized benchmarks is also gaining traction, facilitating objective

comparisons between agents, while increased emphasis on explainability and interpretability

aims to provide deeper insights into agent behavior.

At this point it should be clear that only by continually refining evaluation methods, we will

ensure that AI agents are developed and deployed responsibly, effectively, and ethically in

the coming future.

Multiple Agents & Their Evaluation

Agent evaluation, which assesses the effectiveness, reliability, and adaptability of

autonomous AI agents, as seen in the previous section, has emerged as a key focus area.

We have seen a significant evolution in AI systems, transitioning towards multi-agent

architectures—where multiple specialized agents collaborate to achieve complex objectives.

A multi-agent system is like a team of experts, each specializing in a particular area, working

together to solve a complex problem. Each agent is an independent entity, potentially using a

different LLM, and with its own unique role and context. Agents communicate and collaborate

to achieve a common goal. This approach differs from traditional single-agent systems,

where one LLM handles all aspects of a task.

23

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Multi-agent systems offer several advantages over single-agent systems:

•  Enhanced Accuracy: Agents can cross-check each other's work, leading to more

accurate results.

•

Improved Efficiency: Agents can work in parallel, speeding up task completion.

•  Better Handling of Complex Tasks: Large tasks can be broken down into smaller, more

manageable subtasks, with each agent focusing on a specific aspect.

•

Increased Scalability: The system can be easily scaled by adding more agents with

specialized capabilities.

•

Improved Fault Tolerance: If one agent fails, others can take over its responsibilities.

•  Reduced Hallucinations and Bias: By combining the perspectives of multiple agents,

the system can reduce the effects of hallucinations and bias, leading to more reliable and

trustworthy outputs.

Understanding Multi-Agent Architectures

Unlike traditional monolithic AI systems, multi-agent architectures break down a problem

into distinct tasks handled by specialized agents. Each agent operates with defined roles,

interacting dynamically with others to optimize decision-making, knowledge retrieval, and

execution. These architectures enable more structured reasoning, decentralized problem-

solving, and scalable task automation, offering a paradigm shift from single-agent workflows.

At their core, multi-agent systems leverage principles of modularity, collaboration, and

hierarchy to create a robust AI ecosystem. Agents within these systems can be categorized

based on their function for example:

24

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025•  Planner Agents: Responsible for breaking down high-level objectives into

structured sub-tasks.

•  Retriever Agents: Optimize knowledge acquisition by dynamically fetching relevant data

from external sources.

•  Execution Agents: Perform computations, generate responses, or interact with APIs.

•  Evaluator Agents: Monitor and validate responses, ensuring coherence and alignment

with objectives.

Through these components, multi-agent architectures extend beyond simple prompt-based

interactions, enabling AI-driven workflows that are adaptive, explainable, and efficient.

Multi-Agent Design Patterns and Their Business Impact

To design effective multi-agent architectures, specific design patterns have emerged. These

patterns define interaction protocols, delegation mechanisms, and role distributions, allowing

businesses to implement AI-driven automation in structured ways. Some common design

patterns include:

26

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 7: An image depicting different multi-agent topologies, from LangGraph documentation.23

The choice of design pattern depends on the specific application and the desired level of

interaction between agents.

Businesses benefit from these patterns by reducing operational bottlenecks, improving

knowledge retrieval, and enhancing automation reliability. Multi-agent systems enable

companies to scale AI deployments while ensuring agility in decision-making and

workflow execution.

27

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Important components of Agents

The architecture of LLM-based AI agents consists of several interrelated components

essential for autonomous operation and intelligent interaction:

•

Interaction Wrapper: This component serves as the interface between the agent

and its environment, managing communication and adapting to various input and

output modalities.

•  Memory Management: This includes short-term working memory for immediate context,

cache, and sessions . It also can include long-term storage for learned patterns and

experiences, as episodes, examples, skills or reference data. It also includes “reflection”

to decide which short term items (eg: user preference) should be copied into long term

memory (eg: user profile), and if that can be shared across agents, tasks, or sessions.

•  Cognitive Functionality: This is often underpinned by Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct,

reasoning, thinking, or a planner subsystem - it allows agents to decompose complex

tasks into logical steps and engage in self-correction. In some cases this also includes

user intent refinement, to ask a clarifying question if uncertain.

•  Tool Integration: This subsystem enables agents to utilize external tools, expanding

their capabilities beyond natural language processing. Dynamic tool registries allowing

discovery, registration, and “Tool RAG”.

•  Flow / Routing: This governs connections with other agents, facilitating dynamic neighbor

discovery and efficient communication within the multi-agent system.  This might be

implemented as a delegation of a task to a background agent, or handoff of the user

interaction to an agent, or the use of an agent as a tool.

28

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025•  Feedback Loops / Reinforcement Learning: These enable continuous learning and

adaptation by processing interaction outcomes and refining decision-making strategies.

For gen AI agents this rarely takes the form of traditional RL training, but the performance

metrics of the past can be incorporated into future decision making.

•  Agent Communication: Effective communication between agents is crucial for the

success of multi-agent systems. The Agent to Agent communication protocol facilitates

structured and efficient communication among agents, enabling them to achieve

consensus and address complex problems collaboratively

•  Remote Agent Communication: Agent to Agent communication within an organization

is critical to allows agents to share messages, tasks, and knowledge.  Once your multi-

agent system includes a remote agent, the communication protocol becomes even more

important. Asynchronous tasks and sessions need to be durable, and updated with

notifications while end users are not in session.  Negotiations between Agents must allow

for bringing a user into session and for supported UX capabilities.

•  Agent & Tool Registry (mesh): As you go beyond a handful of tools or a handful of

agents, you need a robust system to discover, register, administer, select and utilize from

a “mesh” of tools or agents.  Critically important is the ontology and description of the

tools and agents, their capabilities and requirements, and their performance metrics. Your

agents will make a plan and choose which tool or which agent to use from such a system,

and those choices are informed by the data in the system

29

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 8: An image demonstrating the process of a user interacting with multiple, self-coordinating agents.24

These architectural elements provide a robust foundation for the autonomous operation and

collaborative capabilities of LLM agents within multi-agent systems.

30

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Challenges in Multi-Agent systems

While multi-agent systems offer numerous advantages, they also face several challenges:

•  Task Communication: Today most agent frameworks communicate in messages, not

structured async tasks.

•  Task Allocation: Efficiently dividing complex tasks among different agents can be

challenging, and feedback loops are often left up to the developer to implement.

•  Coordinating Reasoning: Getting agents to debate and reason together effectively

requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

•  Managing Context: Keeping track of all the information, tasks, and conversations

between agents can be overwhelming.

•  Time and Cost: Multi-agent interactions can be computationally expensive and time-

consuming.  This results in higher runtime prices and more user latency.

•  Complexity: In the same way that microservice architecture allows each microservice

more flexibility and simplicity, the system as a whole usually becomes more complex.

Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing robust and efficient

multi-agent systems.

31

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Multi-Agent Evaluation

Luckily, the evaluation of multi-agent systems is a clear progression of evaluating single

agent systems. Agent Success Metrics are unchanged, business metrics as your north star,

goals and critical task success metrics, application telemetry metrics like latency and errors.

Instrumenting the multi-agent system with trace will help debug and understand what is

happening during complex interactions.

In the Agent Evaluation section we discussed Evaluating Trajectories and Evaluating the Final

Response as the 2 best approaches to automated evaluation of an agent, and this remains

the case for multi-agent systems. For a multi-agent system, a trajectory of actions might

include several or even all of your agents. Even though several agents may collaborate on a

task, a single final answer is returned to the user at the end and can be evaluated in isolation.

Because a multi-agent system probably has more steps, you can drill down and evaluate at

every step.  You can evaluate each of your agents in isolation and the system as a whole.

Trajectory evaluations are a scalable approach to do exactly this.

There are some questions you need to ask, which are unique to multi-agent

systems, including:

•  Cooperation and Coordination: How well do agents work together and coordinate their

actions to achieve common goals?

•  Planning and Task Assignment: Did we come up with the right plan, and did we stick to

it?  Did child agents deviate from the main plan or get lost in a cul-de-sac?

•  Agent Utilization: How effectively do agents select the right agent and choose to use the

agent as a tool, delegate a background task, or transfer the user?

32

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025•  Scalability: Does the system's quality improve as more agents are added?  Does the

latency go down?  Are we being more efficient or less?

These types of questions can guide developers to identify areas for improvement in the

multi-agent system. You will answer these questions using the same tools you use for single

agent systems, but the complexity of the analysis goes up.

Agentic RAG: A Critical Evolution in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation

A significant advancement in multi-agent architectures is Agentic Retrieval-Augmented

Generation (Agentic RAG). Traditional RAG pipelines rely on a static approach—retrieving

knowledge from vector databases and feeding it into an LLM for synthesis. However, this

approach often fails when dealing with ambiguous, multi-step, or multi-perspective queries.

Agentic RAG introduces autonomous retrieval agents that actively refine their search

based on iterative reasoning. These agents enhance retrieval in the following ways:

•  Context-Aware Query Expansion: Instead of relying on a single search pass, agents

generate multiple query refinements to retrieve more relevant and comprehensive results.

•  Multi-Step Reasoning: Agents decompose complex queries into smaller logical steps,

retrieving information sequentially to build structured responses.

•  Adaptive Source Selection: Instead of fetching data from a single vector database,

retrieval agents dynamically select the best knowledge sources based on context.

•  Validation and Correction: Evaluator agents cross-check retrieved knowledge for

hallucinations and contradictions before integrating it into the final response.

33

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025This approach significantly improves response accuracy, explainability, and adaptability,

making it a crucial innovation for enterprises dealing with complex knowledge retrieval tasks

in areas like legal research, scientific discovery, and business intelligence.

Agentic RAG and its Importance

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced approach that combines the

strengths of RAG with the autonomy of AI agents. Traditional RAG systems retrieve relevant

information from external knowledge sources to enhance LLM responses. Agentic RAG

takes this a step further by employing intelligent agents to orchestrate the retrieval process,

evaluate the retrieved information, and make decisions about how to best utilize it.

Agentic RAG offers several advantages over traditional RAG:

•

Improved Accuracy: Agents can evaluate the quality of retrieved information and make

decisions about which sources to trust, leading to more accurate and reliable responses.

•  Enhanced Contextual Understanding: Agents can consider the context of the user's

query and the retrieved information to generate more relevant and meaningful responses.

•

Increased Adaptability: Agents can adapt to changing information needs and

dynamically adjust their retrieval strategies to provide the most up-to-date and relevant

information. This adaptability is crucial in complex domains where information is constantly

evolving, such as healthcare, finance, and legal research.

34

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 9: A diagram of Agentic RAG from Vectorize.io.25

Agentic RAG is particularly valuable in complex domains where information is constantly

evolving, such as healthcare, finance, and legal research. For example, in healthcare, agentic

RAG can help navigate complicated medical databases, research papers, and patient

records, providing doctors with comprehensive and accurate information.

35

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Better Search, Better RAG

Almost all RAG approaches require a search engine to index and retrieve relevant data. The

introduction of agents allows for refinement of query, filtering, ranking, and the final answer.

Agentic RAG agents are executing several searches to retrieve information.

For developers who are trying to optimize existing RAG implementations, it is usually most

valuable to improve search results (measured in recall) prior to introducing agents.  Some of

the main techniques to improve search performance are:

•  Parse source documents and chunk them: Vertex AI Layout Parser can handle complex

document layouts, embedded tables, and embedded images like charts, and uses a

semantic chunker to keep chunks on topic with a hierarchy of headings.

•  Add metadata to your chunks: synonyms, keywords, authors, dates, tags and categories

allow your searches to boost, bury, and filter; these allow your users or your agents more

control over search results.

•  Fine tune the embedding model or add a search adaptor which changes embedding

space: these allow the searchable index of vectors to represent your domain better than a

general purpose embedding model.

•  A faster vector database can improve search quality: to search embeddings, you must

make a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, upgrading to an ultra-fast Vertex AI

Vector Search can improve both latency and quality

•  Use a ranker: vector searches are fast but approximate, they should return dozens or

hundreds of results which need to be re-ranked by a more sophisticated system to ensure

the top few results are the most relevant or best answer.

•

Implement check grounding: as a safeguard on grounded generation, you can ensure

each phrase is actually citable by retrieved chunks.

36

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 10: A diagram of common RAG and search components, showing Vertex AI Search26, search builder
APIs27, and RAG Engine.28

Vertex AI Search26 is a powerful search engine providing Google quality search for your

data and can be used with any RAG or Agentic RAG implementation. Each of the above

components is automatically available within Vertex AI Search, without any development

time at all.  For developers who want to build their own search engine, each of the above

components is exposed as a standalone API27, and RAG Engine28 can orchestrate the whole

pipeline easily, with a LlamaIndex-like Python-based interface.

37

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Agents in the enterprise

Manager of agents

2025 is the year of the agents, and this will particularly be true in the context of enterprises

that will develop and use agents that will assist employees to perform specific tasks

or autonomously run in the background performing automation. Business analysts can

effortlessly uncover industry trends and create compelling, data-driven presentations

fueled by AI-generated insights. HR teams can revolutionize the employee experience with

streamlined onboarding, even for complex tasks like 401k selection. Software engineers

can proactively identify and resolve bugs, enabling them to build and iterate with greater

efficiency, and accelerate deployment cycles. Marketers can unlock deeper performance

analysis, optimize content recommendations, and fine-tune campaigns effortlessly to achieve

better results.

We see two types of agents emerging:

1.  “Assistants”: Agents that interact with the user, take a task, execute it, and come back

to the user. Conversational agents popularized by frameworks like Gems or GPTs usually

belong to this category. Assistants can be general - able to help on a variety of tasks - or

specialized to a particular domain, or tasks. Examples include agents that help schedule

meetings, analyze data, write code, write marketing press releases, help sellers with

sales opportunities, or even agents that perform deep research on a particular topic

as requested by the user. These agents can be synchronous and return the requested

information or perform the requested task fast, or they run for a longer period of time

before returning (like the deep research agents).

38

Agents CompanionFebruary 20252.  "Automation agents”: Agents that run in the background, listen to events, monitor

changes in systems or data, and then make smart decisions and act. Action might include

acting on backend systems, performing some tests to validate the observation, fixing

problems, notifying the right employees, etc. This can really be seen as the backbone of

the automation of the future. While in the past we had to write special code to specify

the logic of automations, now we can start relying on smart and general decision making

abilities of AI agents.

Rather than simply invoking agents to perform a task and wait for the output, knowledge

workers will increasingly become managers of agents. They will be assigning tasks to multiple

agents and manage them, check if any of agents need help or require approval to proceed,

use the output of specific agents to start new tasks, monitor execution of long running tasks

to review and steer them in the right direction. Novel user interfaces to allow this type of

virtual team management will emerge to allow orchestration, monitoring and managing a

multi-agent system with agents performing tasks, calling (or even creating) other agents.

Google Agentspace aims at providing this type of experience and allow to:

•  Create new agents by using a no/low code interface or a full code framework to

implement both specialized assistants and automation agents

•  Configure and manage the agents access for company administrators

•

Invoke the right agents when appropriate

•  Monitor, manage, and orchestrate multiple agents in a UI suited for team management

scalable AI adoption. Custom agents will connect with internal and external systems and

data, be tailored to company domain and policies, and potentially even utilize machine

learning models trained on proprietary business data. The platform provides builders tools

for agent development, deployment, and lifecycle management.

45

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025From agents to contractors

The common interface to define AI agents across various tools and platforms today is very

simple, and usually includes specifying the goal, some textual instructions, the tools that the

agent can use, and a set of examples. While this might be sufficient to prototype demos, it

leads to potentially underspecified definitions, and might be one of the leading reasons that

AI agents can struggle to get from prototype-to-production.

We propose to evolve the Agent interface to evolve them into ”Contract adhering agents”

which are aimed at solving complex tasks using AI Agents, more specifically in contexts

where stakes are high.

Contracts

The key idea of contractors is to specify and standardize the contracts between the

requester and the agents, making it possible to:

1.  Define the outcomes as precisely as possible, similarly to what we would do in a

real world scenario when agreeing on a service with a company we are contracting to

do something for us. This allows the agent (contractor) to validate against the desired

outcomes and iterate until the desired objective is achieved.

2.  Make it possible to negotiate the task as well as clarifying and refining it, in order

to avoid any ambiguity in the definition, and fill any gap in common understanding of

the goals.

3.  Define the rules for the contractors to generate new subcontracts needed to solve the

bigger one in a standard fashion (cf. section below on subcontracts).

The following illustration shows the lifecycle of defining, negotiating and executing the

contract:

Figure 13: A diagram of the agent as contractor lifecycle from Agentspace.

Contract execution

This requires the contractor runtime to be able to fulfill the contracts and solve the

tasks behind contracts according to their defined specifications. Prioritizing quality and

completeness over latency enables to fully leverage the capabilities of LLMs, for example

49

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025by generating different solutions, and reviewing, scoring, and evolving them. An example of

this methodology is shown below in the Co-Scientist study. The engine can iterate and self-

validate the results and deliverables based on the provided expectations, and can improve

and self-correct until the validators are fulfilled. The ability to concretely validate a solution

against a set of objective criteria has proven to work extremely well in the context of AI and

has been at the core of successful AI systems such as for example Alpha-Code.

Contract Negotiation

One core hypothesis behind contracts in the context of automation agents specifically is that

many tasks in the enterprise world can draw significant benefit from leveraging the power of

LLMs when used in a less-constrained manner (latency and cost wise).

Being able to tackle more and more complex tasks and making it possible for customers to

be able to rely on and trust the results of contractors will ensure real value for companies.

Even that being said, we need to have a notion of relative priority in order to make sure that

tasks are appropriately prioritized as well as resources fairly allocated. We thus introduce a

notion of cost (typically relative per customer or contract initiator) which can be discussed

and negotiated between the contract initiator and the contractor, in order to make sure that

the contract receives the adequate resources relative to the other contracts initiated by the

contract initiator. The contractors can also negotiate other aspects of the contracts, for

example in terms of specification and deliverables (cf. also section below on feedback).

50

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Contract Feedback

Contracts give a vehicle to provide feedback and in particular resolve ambiguities. As tasks

become more and more complex, it is critical to be able to raise ambiguities or other issues

related to the tasks specifications as early as possible.  Contractors can give feedback on the

contract just after having received the contract (initial contract assessment), and then at a

frequency predefined in the contract.

This feedback will contain clarification requests, or other types of feedback about the

underspecification or misspecification of tasks (inconsistencies, conflicting specs,

clarification, etc.).

Subcontracts

Although not part of the contract definition and specification directly, the ability to

decompose a task into subtasks by generating subcontracts is a core concept that will be

used to power the contractors’ engine.

When a task is considered too complex to be tackled directly, contractors can decide to

decompose the task into smaller and easier tasks, which will be added to the execution

queue for solving.  This is made possible only through the contract formalization described

above, which makes it possible for the contractors to generate, process and manipulate

other contracts in a uniform and standardized way.

51

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Google's Co-Scientist: A Case Study in
Multi-Agent Intelligence

Google's AI co-scientist is a prime example of a multi-agent LLM system applied to scientific

research. This system utilizes a team of specialized agents, each with its own role and

expertise, to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery. These agents collaborate to

generate, evaluate, and refine hypotheses, mirroring the iterative process of scientific inquiry.

The co-scientist system employs a "generate, debate, and evolve" approach, drawing

inspiration from the scientific method. This approach involves generating diverse hypotheses,

critically evaluating their potential, and refining them through ongoing feedback and analysis.

The system leverages the strengths of different LLMs, each specializing in a particular aspect

of the research process, to achieve a more comprehensive and robust outcome.

For instance, in a study on liver fibrosis treatments, the co-scientist not only identified

existing drugs but also proposed new mechanisms and promising drug candidates,

demonstrating its potential to generate novel insights. Some of its major components are:

•  Data Processing Agents: aggregate and structure large volumes of experimental data.

•  Hypothesis Generators: propose potential explanations based on existing research and

new findings.

•  Validation Agents: run simulations and verify results before presenting them

to researchers.

•  Collaboration Agents: communicate findings across different research teams, enhancing

interdisciplinary cooperation.

52

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 14: A process diagram of the AI co-scientist system31

This approach exemplifies how multi-agent architectures move beyond static AI interactions,

instead fostering dynamic, evolving intelligence capable of handling sophisticated tasks in

research, enterprise automation, and knowledge management.

53

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Automotive AI: Real World Use of
Multi-Agent Architecture

To illustrate how multi-agent concepts manifest in practice, let's examine a comprehensive

multi-agent system designed for automotive conversational AI, where several specialized

agents collaborate to provide an intuitive and seamless in-car experience.

First, we’ll look at some examples of specialized agents, followed by some common patterns

for combining them to form a multi-agent system.

Specialized Agents

Let’s first look at some examples of specialized agents.

Conversational Navigation Agent

The Conversational Navigation Agent is specialized in helping users find locations, suggest

places, and navigate using APIs like Google Places and Maps. This agent understands

navigation intents like "Find me a sushi restaurant nearby," queries the Places API for relevant

results, re-ranks these results based on user preferences and historical data, and sends

navigation commands to the car's built-in system.

54

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Example Interaction:

User: "I need to take a break for lunch. What are good restaurants on my route

to Munich?"

Navigation Agent: "I found three well-rated restaurants along your route on the A9. In 25

kilometers, there's 'Gasthaus Alte Mühle' at the Ingolstadt exit with 4.5 stars - reviewers

praise their traditional Bavarian dishes and beer garden. In 45 kilometers, 'La Strada' at

the service area has 4.1 stars with good reviews for quick Italian meals. Or if you can wait

70 kilometers, 'Zeitlos' near Allershausen has 4.7 stars - it's a bit fancier with farm-to-table

cuisine. Which one interests you most?"

User: "The Bavarian place sounds good. Is there convenient parking there, and how far is

it from the motorway?"

Navigation Agent: "Gasthaus Alte Mühle has a dedicated parking area with about 40

spaces. It's only 1.2 kilometers from the A9 exit at Ingolstadt-Nord - about a 2-minute drive.

They're known for their Schweinebraten and homemade dumplings. It gets busy around

noon, but it's currently showing moderate occupancy. Would you like me to set this as your

destination and guide you there? You'll arrive around 12:15 if we head there now."

Conversational Media Search Agent

The Conversational Media Search Agent is specialized in helping users find and play music,

audiobooks, and podcasts. This agent retrieves media from local databases or streaming

services, uses web search for additional content when necessary, suggests media based on

contextual factors like mood, weather, and time of day, and handles voice commands such

as "Play a relaxing playlist for my drive." It also identifies similar artists or content when users

ask questions like "Who sounds like John Coltrane?"

55

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Example Interaction:

User: "Play something upbeat to help me stay alert on this long motorway drive."

Conversational Media Search Agent: "I'll play an upbeat driving playlist to help keep

you energized. Starting with 'Don't Stop Me Now' by Queen, followed by some Daft

Punk and Stromae tracks. I've added some popular European radio hits that match your

preferences. I've adjusted the volume for optimal road awareness. Just say 'next' if you

want to skip a song."

Message Composition Agent

The Message Composition Agent is specialized in helping users draft, summarize, and send

messages or emails while driving. This agent parses voice commands like "Tell Alex I'm

running late," uses natural language models to compose contextually appropriate messages,

offers draft previews with user modification options, and integrates with various messaging

apps including SMS, WhatsApp, and email.

Example Interaction:

User: "There's heavy traffic on the E40. Let my team know I'll be 20 minutes late to the

morning standup."

Message Composition Agent: "I've prepared a message to your work team: 'Stuck in

traffic on the E40. Will be about 20 minutes late to our morning standup. Please start

without me.' Should I send this to your 'Work Team' chat group, or would you like to edit

it first?"

56

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Car Manual Agent

The Car Manual Agent is specialized in providing answers to car-related questions by

leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This agent retrieves relevant

sections from the car manual based on user queries, summarizes and contextualizes this

information using an LLM, and links users to detailed documentation or instructional videos

when appropriate.

Example Interaction:

User: "How do I turn off the lane-keeping assist feature in this Volkswagen?"

Car Manual Agent: "To turn off lane-keeping assist in your Volkswagen, press the

button with the car-and-lane icon located on the left side of your steering wheel. You'll

see a confirmation in the driver display when it's deactivated. You can also disable

it permanently in the infotainment system under Settings > Driver Assistance > Lane

Keeping. Would you like me to walk you through the settings menu instead?"

General Knowledge Agent

The General Knowledge Agent is specialized in answering factual questions about the world,

history, science, culture, and other general topics. This agent accesses a broad knowledge

base to answer factual questions, provides biographical information about people, offers

contextual explanations of concepts and phenomena, maintains grounding in factual

information while avoiding hallucinations, and responds to follow-up questions by maintaining

contextual awareness.

Example Interaction:

User: "Tell me an interesting fact about Salzburg."

57

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025General Knowledge Agent: "Salzburg, Austria is the birthplace of Mozart, one of

history's most famous composers. Beyond that well-known fact, Salzburg's old town is a

UNESCO World Heritage site, and parts of the beloved musical 'The Sound of Music' were

filmed there in 1964. The Salzburg Festival, one of the world's most prestigious music and

drama festivals, has been held there annually since 1920."

Patterns in Use

Let’s look at the some common ways used to combine these agents.

Hierarchical Pattern

A central Orchestrator Agent classifies queries and routes them to specialized agents. For

example, when a user asks "Find me a sushi restaurant nearby," the Orchestrator detects

this as a navigation request and routes it to the Navigation Agent, which handles location

searches and interaction with maps APIs.

Figure 15. Hierarchical pattern.

58

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025The Orchestrator Agent is specialized in routing queries to the most appropriate specialized

agents and managing the overall conversation flow. This agent analyzes user queries to

determine domain and intent, directs requests to the most suitable specialized agent,

maintains conversation context across multiple turns, and manages fallback strategies when

specialized agents cannot provide satisfactory responses.

Example Interaction:

First Turn:

User: "Is there a service area ahead with clean toilets?"

Orchestrator Agent: [internally routes to Navigation Agent]

Navigation Agent: "There's a service area 20 kilometers ahead on the E19. It's Aire

de Waremme, which was renovated last year and has good ratings for facilities and

cleanliness. It also has a Paul bakery and a quick-service restaurant."

Second Turn:

User: "Will it rain at my destination this evening?"

Orchestrator Agent: [recognizes weather query and routes to Weather

Information Agent]

Weather Information Agent: "At your destination in Brussels, the forecast shows a 60%

chance of light rain in the evening, starting around 19:00. Temperatures will be around

14°C. I'd recommend bringing an umbrella if you plan to be outdoors."

59

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Diamond Pattern

In this variation of the hierarchical pattern, responses from specialized agents pass

through a central moderation agent before reaching the user. For instance, the Navigation

Agent generates a factual response about a nearby restaurant, which then goes through

a Rephraser Agent that adjusts the tone and style based on user preferences before

text-to-speech synthesis.

The Rephraser Agent is specialized in adapting the tone, style, and presentation of responses

to match user preferences and context. This agent transforms technical information into

conversational language, adjusts response length based on driving conditions and urgency,

personalizes communication style to match user preferences, and formats complex

information for easier comprehension while driving.

Example Interaction:

[Raw response from Car Manual Agent before rephrasing]: "In the event of a tire

pressure monitoring system alert, the vehicle has detected that one or more tires have

fallen below the recommended inflation pressure of 2.2 bar. The affected tire's pressure is

approximately 1.8 bar, which is 18.75% below recommended levels. This does not constitute

an immediate safety hazard, but prolonged driving with underinflated tires can lead to

decreased fuel efficiency, reduced tire longevity, and potentially compromised handling

characteristics. It is advisable to proceed to a service station at your earliest convenience

to reinflate the tire to proper specifications."

Rephraser Agent: [Adapts for driving context, adjusts information density and urgency]

Final Response to User: "Your front right tire is a bit low - down to 1.8 bar. It's safe to

keep driving, but you'll want to add some air at the next petrol station. Low tire pressure

can affect your fuel economy and make the tire wear out faster. I can help you find a

nearby place to fill up if you'd like."

Example transformation:

Initial Response (factual & neutral): "I found a highly-rated sushi restaurant nearby. It's

called Sakura Sushi, located at 123 Main Street. It has a 4.7-star rating and is open until 10

PM. Would you like me to start navigation?"

After rephrasing (playful style): "Sushi craving? Say no more! Head over to Sakura Sushi

at 123 Main Street, where the fish is fresh and the soy sauce flows freely! Rated 4.7 stars,

open till 10 PM. Ready for an umami adventure?”

61

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Peer-to-Peer

Agents can hand off queries to one another when they detect that the orchestration

made a routing mistake. This creates a more resilient system that can recover from

initial misclassifications.

Figure 17. Peer-to-peer.

Example scenario:

1.  User asks: "Find a place to eat sushi nearby"

2.  The Orchestrator correctly routes this to the Conversational Navigation Agent, which

provides information about nearby sushi restaurants.

3.  User follows up: "How big is New York's Central Park?"

4.  The Orchestrator might initially route this to the Conversational Navigation Agent again

(based on the previous navigation-related conversation).

62

Agents CompanionFebruary 20255.  However, the Conversational Navigation Agent recognizes this as a general knowledge

question rather than a navigation request, and hands it off to the General Knowledge

Agent, which can provide factual information about Central Park's size.

Advantages of peer-to-peer hand-off compared to centralized orchestration:

1.  Resilience to misclassification: Even if the central orchestrator makes an error in

routing, specialized agents can recognize when a query falls outside their domain and

redirect appropriately.

2.  Domain expertise in routing: Specialized agents often have better understanding of the

boundaries of their own domains. The Media Search Agent knows exactly what kinds of

music-related queries it can handle better than a general orchestrator would.

3.  Reduced orchestration complexity: The central orchestrator doesn't need perfect

accuracy in initial routing, reducing the complexity of its decision-making logic.

Collaborative Pattern

The Collaborative Pattern involves multiple agents working on complementary aspects of

the same task, with a Response Mixer Agent that combines elements from different agent

responses to create a comprehensive answer. This approach recognizes that different agents

contribute valuable pieces to a complete solution based on their specialized expertise. The

pattern is particularly valuable when:

1.  Different aspects of a query require different types of expertise (e.g., technical

specifications, practical advice, and conceptual explanations)

2.  No single agent has complete information to fully address the user's needs

3.  The user would benefit from multiple perspectives on the same question

63

Agents CompanionFebruary 20254.  Different specialized agents have access to distinct knowledge bases or

reasoning capabilities

Unlike the competitive approach where responses compete, the collaborative pattern

assumes that responses from different agents are complementary rather than redundant.

The Response Mixer Agent identifies the most valuable information from each source and

synthesizes it into a cohesive answer that leverages the unique strengths of each specialist.

For example, when asked about handling hydroplaning, the Car Manual Agent contributes

vehicle-specific safety system information, the Driving Tips Agent provides practical driving

techniques, and the General Knowledge Agent explains the physics behind the phenomenon.

Together, they create a more complete and useful response than any single agent could

provide alone.

64

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Figure 18. Collaborative pattern.

65

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025Response Mixer Agent

The Response Mixer is specialized in picking the best responses from multiple agents

and merging them when needed. This agent evaluates answers based on their accuracy

and relevance, removes incorrect information, and combines useful parts from different

responses to create the most helpful answer for the user.

Example Interaction:

User: "How do I handle aquaplaning?"

[Behind the scenes, multiple agents generate responses:]

Car Manual Agent Response: "Your Audi is equipped with Electronic Stability Control

(ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) which help prevent aquaplaning by maintaining

traction control." [Confidence score: 71%]

General Knowledge Agent Response: "Aquaplaning occurs when your tires lose contact

with the road surface due to water buildup between the tires and the road." [Confidence

score: 65%]

Safety Tips Agent Response: "If you experience aquaplaning, ease off the accelerator,

avoid sudden braking or steering, and gently steer in the direction you want to go until you

regain traction." [Confidence score: 94%]

Response Mixer Agent: [Picks the most relevant parts and merges them into one

complete answer]

Final Response to User: "If you experience aquaplaning, which happens when your

tires lose contact with the road due to water buildup, ease off the accelerator, avoid

sudden braking or steering, and gently steer in the direction you want to go until you

regain traction. Your Audi's Electronic Stability Control and ABS systems will help maintain

control, but proper driving technique is still essential."

66

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025This competitive approach ensures that critical safety information isn't missed due to

misrouting, and the user receives the most helpful possible response even when their query

has multiple valid interpretations.

Adaptive Loop Pattern

The Adaptive Loop Pattern involves iterative refinement through repeated attempts,

progressively improving results until they meet desired criteria.

The Conversational Navigation Agent can implement a loop pattern to iteratively improve

search results when initial queries don't yield satisfactory outcomes.

Example Interaction:

1.  User asks: "Find a nice Italian restaurant that serves vegan options"

2.  The Navigation Agent queries Places API with these parameters

3.  The agent evaluates the results and finds no restaurants meeting all criteria

4.  Instead of returning "no results," the agent automatically reformulates the query:

•  First loop: Searches for "Italian restaurants with vegetarian options"

•  Second loop: Broadens to "Italian restaurants" and then filters for those mentioning

plant-based options

•  Third loop: If still unsuccessful, searches for "vegan restaurants" and filters for

Italian-influenced cuisine

5.  The agent presents the best matches from these progressive searches, explaining how

they relate to the original request

67

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025This looping behavior enables more robust search capabilities that adapt to availability and

context, providing useful results even when exact matches aren't available.

Advantages of Multi-Agent Architecture for Automotive AI

Multi-agent systems bring powerful advantages to automotive AI by breaking down complex

tasks into specialized roles. Think of it as assembling a team of experts rather than relying on

one generalist.

In this approach, each agent specializes in what it does best. The Navigation Agent focuses

solely on finding locations and planning routes. The Media Search Agent becomes an

expert in music and podcasts. The Car Manual Agent specializes in vehicle features and

troubleshooting. By focusing on specific domains, each agent develops deeper capabilities in

its area.

This specialization makes the entire system more efficient. When an agent handles a

narrower set of tasks, it becomes simpler to optimize its performance. The result is higher

quality responses delivered more quickly and at lower computational cost. Performance

improves because the system can match the right resources to each task. Simple requests

use minimal processing power, while complex questions tap into more powerful resources

only when needed.

Speed matters in a vehicle, and multi-agent systems deliver where it counts. Critical

functions like adjusting climate controls or opening windows run on fast, on-device

agents for immediate response. Meanwhile, less urgent tasks like finding restaurant

recommendationscan use cloud-based agents with more extensive knowledge. This

separation ensures that essential vehicle controls remain responsive regardless of what else

the system is doing.

68

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025This design also creates natural resilience. If internet connectivity drops the essential

functions running on on-device agents continue working. You might temporarily lose

restaurant recommendations, but climate control and basic media playbacks still

function perfectly.

Agent Builder

Vertex AI Agent Builder is a collection of products and services for developers. We have

put together a comprehensive platform for you to build and connect agents. The engineering

excellence and security from Google Cloud, the AI research from Google Deepmind, and the

best practices of AgentOps. Google Cloud is building our own agents on top of this platform,

and now you can too. Expect many more exciting announcements 2025 targeting developers

of agents.

Vertex AI Agent Engine streamlines development, relying on Google engineering managed

integrations with popular open source agent libraries. It provides a managed autoscaling

runtime and many services agents will need (eg: session, examples, trace, evals). This is the

very low effort and high value way to safely deploy agents you have written in any framework.

Vertex AI Eval Service provides all of the evaluation tools discussed in this whitepaper, and

more. LLMs, RAG, and Agent evals are stable and scalable via the Vertex AI Eval Service, with

convenient integrations into monitoring and experimentation offerings.

A large portfolio of agent tools, with more to watch out for:

•  Retrieval via Vertex AI Search26 or RAG Engine28.

•  Non-search based retrieval from DBs via Gen AI Toolbox for Databases32

69

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025•  Application integrations33 with hundreds of APIs supporting full ACLs

•  Turn any API into a managed, enterprise ready tool with Apigee Hub34

And of course the best LLMs for agents, with access to Vertex AI Model Garden35 and also

the Gemini family of models36 which will power the agentic era.

Summary

This whitepaper (a companion to our earlier whitepaper on Agents) has explored the rapidly

evolving landscape of generative AI agents, from their fundamental architecture to advanced

evaluation techniques and the transformative potential of multi-agent systems.

Key Takeaways for Developers:

1.  AgentOps is Essential: Building successful agents goes far beyond the initial proof-

of-concept. Embrace AgentOps principles, integrating best practices from DevOps and

MLOps, but also focusing on agent-specific elements like tool management, orchestration,

memory, and task decomposition.

2.  Metrics Drive Improvement: Start with business-level KPIs (like goal completion, user

engagement, or revenue) as your "north star." Then, instrument your agents to track

granular metrics related to critical tasks, user interactions, and agent actions (traces).

Human feedback (👍👍, user surveys) is invaluable.

3.  Automated Evaluation is Key: Don't rely solely on manual testing.  Implement automated

evaluation frameworks that assess agent capabilities, trajectory (the steps taken), and the

final response. Leverage techniques like exact match, in-order match, precision/recall for

trajectory evaluation, and autoraters (LLMs as judges) for final response quality.

70

Agents CompanionFebruary 20254.  Human-in-the-Loop is Crucial: Automated metrics are powerful, but human evaluation

provides essential context, especially for subjective aspects like creativity, common sense,

and nuance. Use human feedback to calibrate and validate your automated evaluation

methods. Don’t outsource the domain knowledge.

5.  Multi-Agent Systems Offer Advantages: Consider multi-agent architectures for

complex tasks. They can improve accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance.

Understand different design patterns (sequential, hierarchical, collaborative, competitive)

and choose the right one for your application.

6.  Agentic RAG Improves Relevance: Move beyond traditional RAG by incorporating

agents that actively refine search queries, evaluate retrieved information, and adapt to

evolving knowledge. This leads to more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

7.  Search Optimization is Foundational to RAG: Before diving into complex agentic RAG,

optimize your underlying search engine. Techniques like semantic chunking, metadata

enrichment, fine-tuning embedding models, and using rankers can significantly improve

retrieval quality.

8.  Agent and Tool Registries are Important: As the number of Agents or Tools you

are using grow, a registry to manage the capabilities, ontology, and performance

becomes essential.

9.  Security is Paramount: When deploying agents, especially within an enterprise, prioritize

security. Leverage platforms like Google Agentspace that offer built-in security features

like RBAC, VPC Service Controls, and IAM integration.

10. Efficient use of developer cycles: The classic build vs buy design choices remain front

of mind, as the industry of gen AI agents is rapidly evolving. Consider platforms and

products as alternatives to building everything from scratch. This will buffer some of the

churn of a fast changing industry and allow you to focus on your data, domain, and users.

71

Agents CompanionFebruary 202511. Agents in the enterprise: Agents are transforming the way we work by making us much

more productive, and the way automation can be accomplished. Knowledge workers will

increasingly be managing fleets of agents and novel UX will emerge. Google Agentspace

is a powerful tool allowing to put Enterprise Search, AI and AI Agents on top of company’s

data and workflows

Future Directions for Agent Research and Development: The field of AI agents is

undergoing rapid evolution.  Key areas of ongoing research and development include:

•  Advanced Evaluation Methods: Developing more robust and scalable evaluation

techniques, including process-based evaluation (focusing on reasoning), AI-assisted

evaluation, and standardized benchmarks.

•  Multi-Agent Coordination: Improving the coordination and communication mechanisms

within multi-agent systems to enable more effective collaboration, task handling,

and reasoning.

•  Real-World Adaptation: Creating agents that can adapt and learn in dynamic,

unpredictable real-world environments. Production systems like automotive AI

illustrate how agents must balance between on-device performance for critical

functions and cloud-based capabilities for complex tasks, often adapting to changing

connectivity conditions.

•  Explainability and Interpretability: Making agent behavior more transparent and

understandable, allowing developers and users to gain deeper insights into their

decision-making processes.

•  Long-Term Memory and Learning: Developing more sophisticated memory mechanisms

that allow agents to retain and utilize information over extended periods, enabling

continuous learning and adaptation.

72

Agents CompanionFebruary 2025•  Agent Communication Protocols: Better defining how agents share tasks, knowledge,

and messages, especially across remote systems which are opaque.

•  From Agents to contractors: In order for agents to get to next level of reliability and

utility, we will need to step up the definition of tasks, making them into contracts with clear

deliverables, validation mechanisms, and ability to negotiate ambiguities, similarly to how

we contract work from other companies.
